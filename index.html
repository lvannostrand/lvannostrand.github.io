				<div class="content"><p>I love improv, sketch comedy and riding my bike. I've been known to travel. I'm becoming more socially and medially and social medially aware. You can find me most nights at The Peoples Improv Theater either taking classes, watching shows or trying to do improv. I'm from way far upstate New York (yes, there is a whole state) and went to school in Boston. I studied abroad in London in the Spring of 2011 and loved it so much that I stayed at my internship for the summer. When I got offered a job at that same company after I graduated, I didn't hesitate and moved back to London only to stay for four years working in consumer and retail research. Living abroad changed my world view, allowed me to meet lifelong friends from all over the world, and got me to travel extensively. I've lived in NYC since 2006 and was a workaholic in Private Equity Investor Relations (a.k.a. marketing and relationship management in finance) for five and a half years. Having realized that there is more to life, I quit my job in 2012 and embarked on a year full of travel, bike riding, and discovering my passion for improv and sketch comedy, and well, actually, comedy in general.</p>
				<p>Currently I'm a Technical Marketing student at Startup Institute NY, which is a a spinoff of TechStars. It's a selective program designed to hone techniical skills across the startup industry.
